# Etch-A-Sketch

Initially written for fun - an etch a sketch which also plays Conway's Game of Life.

I am now using this as the basis for my Odin Project Etch-A-Sketch mini project.


Currently only supports one color (grey).

You can press the start button and it will play Conway's Game of Life with whatever you've sketched.
